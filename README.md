# weather-reminder
## my little project for learn golang

### startup background
- I often find myself wishing there was a display at the front door that could show the weather. It was this thought that inspired me to start this project.

### Goals and Skills
- My goal was to design an API as crisp as Kendrick Lamar's 'Not like Us' and animations as smooth as those like Luther.
- To achieve this, I mainly used Go and htmx.
